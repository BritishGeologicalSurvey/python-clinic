# How to open up a Jupyter notebook (anaconda)

1. Open up Anaconda prompt 

2. Activate your environment

   ```
   activate my_environment
   ```

   Change to the directory that holds the notebook

   ```
   cd /d directory/where/data/is
   #  ~ or ~
   cd directory/where/data/is
   ```

3. Activate Jupyter notebook

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. This will open a browser showing the directory you are in - click on the notebook (file extension: .ipynb) you want to open (e.g. Pandas.ipynb)

**Note that the notebook *speaks* to the python environment you have activated. If the notebook uses packages that are not within your environment, you'll need to install them.**
